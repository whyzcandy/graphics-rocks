   	"abstract": "We introduce a complete morphological analysis framework for 3D point clouds. Starting from an unorganized point set sampling a surface, we propose morphological operators in the form of projections, allowing to sample erosions, dilations, closings and openings of an object without any explicit mesh structure. Our framework supports structuring elements with arbitrary shape, accounts robustly for geometric and morphological sharp features, remains efficient at large scales and comes together with a specific adaptive sampler. Based on this meshless framework, we propose applications which benefit from the non-linear nature of morphological analysis and can be expressed as simple sequences of our operators, including medial axis sampling, hysteresis shape filtering and geometry-preserving topological simplification."

   	"abstract": "Any sampled point acquired from a real-world geometric object or scene represents a finite surface area and not just a single surface point. Samples therefore have an inherent scale, very valuable information that has been crucial for high quality reconstructions. We introduce a new method for surface reconstruction from oriented, scale-enabled sample points which operates on large, redundant and potentially noisy point sets. The approach draws upon a simple yet efficient mathematical formulation to construct an implicit function as the sum of compactly supported basis functions. The implicit function has spatially continuous \"floating\" scale and can be readily evaluated without any preprocessing. The final surface is extracted as the zero-level set of the implicit function. One of the key properties of the approach is that it is virtually parameter-free even for complex, mixed-scale datasets. In addition, our method is easy to implement, scalable and does not require any global operations. We evaluate our method on a wide range of datasets for which it compares favorably to popular classic and current methods."

   	"abstract": "With better and faster acquisition devices comes a demand for fast robust reconstruction algorithms, but no L1-based technique has been fast enough for online use so far. In this paper, we present a novel continuous formulation of the weighted locally optimal projection (WLOP) operator based on a Gaussian mixture describing the input point density. Our method is up to 7 times faster than an optimized GPU implementation of WLOP, and achieves interactive frame rates for moderately sized point clouds. We give a comprehensive quality analysis showing that our continuous operator achieves a generally higher reconstruction quality than its discrete counterpart. Additionally, we show how to apply our continuous formulation to spherical mixtures of normal directions, to also achieve a fast robust normal reconstruction.",

   	"abstract": "We formalize the notion of sampling a function using k-d darts. A k-d dart is a set of independent, mutually orthogonal, k-dimensional subspaces called k-d flats. Each dart has d choose k flats, aligned with the coordinate axes for efficiency. We show that k-d darts are useful for exploring a function's properties, such as estimating its integral, or finding an exemplar above a threshold. We describe a recipe for converting an algorithm from point sampling to k-d dart sampling, assuming the function can be evaluated along a k-d flat. We demonstrate that k-d darts are more efficient than point-wise samples in high dimensions, depending on the characteristics of the sampling domain: e.g. the subregion of interest has small volume and evaluating the function along a flat is not too expensive. We present three concrete applications using line darts (1-d darts): relaxed maximal Poisson-disk sampling, high-quality rasterization of depth-of-field blur, and estimation of the probability of failure from a response surface for uncertainty quantification. In these applications, line darts achieve the same fidelity output as point darts in less time. We also demonstrate the accuracy of higher dimensional darts for a volume estimation problem. For Poisson-disk sampling, we use significantly less memory, enabling the generation of larger point clouds in higher dimensions."

   	"abstract": "This paper presents a novel three dimensional (3D) flower modeling technique that utilizes an X-ray computed tomography (CT) system and real-world flowers. Although a CT system provides volume data that captures the internal structures of flowers, it is difficult to accurately segment them into regions of particular organs and model them as smooth surfaces because a flower consists of thin organs that contact one another. We thus introduce a semiautomatic modeling technique that is based on a new active contour model with energy functionals designed for flower CT. Our key idea is to approximate flower components by two important primitives, a shaft and a sheet. Based on our active contour model, we also provide novel user interfaces and a numerical scheme to fit these primitives so as to reconstruct realistic thin flower organs efficiently. To demonstrate the feasibility of our technique, we provide various flower models reconstructed from CT volumes. ",
